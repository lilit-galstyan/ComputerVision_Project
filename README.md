Welcome to my group's Text-to-Image Generation project.

Our computer vision endeavor transforms textual prompts into captivating visual representations leveraging the Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth models.

By harnessing stable diffusion techniques, our model achieves remarkable stability and coherence in image generation. Integrated with DreamBooth models, the model is fine-tuned in a way to get the desired output, pushing the boundaries of creativity and imagination. 

Join us in exploring the fusion of text and imagery through advanced computer vision technologies.
